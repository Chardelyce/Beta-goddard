# Beta-goddard
Hello :) this is the beta build of the Goddar.va application now live ! I made this winform one way back in May of 2021 


- to use this properly you will everywhere in the code you see a directory you will have to map it to your own like for example is says "c:/barkbark"
and you have your wav file for the bark in donwloads you will hav to change that directory , other than that self explan and there are the command list included as well .
